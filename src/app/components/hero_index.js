                            It is always about control, too many times recoil causes the gun to rise taking the barrel off the target.  Our technology keeps the recoiled energy contained in a linear direction, keeping the barrel aimed down range versus lifting in the air. </p>

                        <h2 className="font-bebasNeue text-gray.400 lg:text-4xl text-3xl pb-2">Versatility</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray.500 text-xl leading-relaxed pb-8">
                            Our technology offers customizable magnet strength configurations, allowing users to tailor the system to their specific needs and experience levels. Whether for a novice or an expert, the Brujeria Buffer Tube can be fine-tuned for optimal performance.
                        </p>

                        <p className="text-gray.500 text-xl leading-relaxed pb-8">
                            The magnets in Fry Tech's system reduce direct linear motion, while the added weight within the buffer tube enhances overall stability during shooting.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="font-bebasNeue text-gray.400 lg:text-4xl text-3xl pb-2">Dependability</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray.500 text-xl leading-relaxed ">
                            Traditional springs weaken over time, increasing recoil. Fry Tech's magnets are encased for protection and rigorously tested, withstanding over 15,000 rounds per buffer tube to ensure long-lasting, reliable performance.
